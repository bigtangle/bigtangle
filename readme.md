# BigTangle is a protocol for the internet of value.

 * BigTangle is a cryptocurrency network extending the directed acyclic graph with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) 
as consensus algorithm and distributed Proof-of-Work. 
 * Through the use of industry standard big data technology in conjunction with the parallelizable architecture, 
BigTangle sees itself as a successor to Bitcoin and Ethereum that blockchain and smart contract are BigTangle special use case.  
 * BigTangle focuses on economically important key use-cases. Custom token issuances, market, exchange, mining and contract are supported.
 * Key Feartures are: Ease of Use, Completely Feeless, Real-Time Confirmation, Infinite Scalability, Permissionless, Trustless, Decentralized, Distributed Proof of Work and Quantum Security.

## Payment

By providing scalable infrastructure, BigTangle allows the global transaction volume to be processed in one network. 
Most importantly, this offers infrastructural cost advantages by eliminating complex, 
costly processes of traditional payment processing.

## Fiat Money
For banks and central banks, the token issuance protocol can be used to issue bank-backed tokens denoting conventional fiat money. Fiat money transactions can then feasibly be processed within seconds on a worldwide scale.

## Markets

Markets for stocks, bonds etc. can easily be realized by creating new token equivalents. Companies can publish stocks and use the BigTangle network. The existing stock markets can be fully integrated by using BigTangle as a financial back-end.

## Supply Chain
Under the assumption of trustworthy suppliers issuing authenticity tokens, it is trivial to track product authenticity via token transfers. This allows the trustless tracking of inventories in supply chains for consumers and middlemen alike.

## Decentralized E-commerce Platforms

All products and services can be tracked on the network, enabling anyone to build decentralized e-commerce platforms.

## Distributed Storage

## distributed Application
