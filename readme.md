# Cryptocurrency, Payments, Assets, Exchange, and Web3 Platform

BigTangle is a cutting-edge cryptocurrency network that revolutionizes traditional blockchain technology by integrating the **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)** method. Combining standard technologies with a highly parallelizable architecture, BigTangle is designed to outperform Bitcoin and Ethereum, offering blockchain and smart contracts as specialized applications within its robust ecosystem. The network’s consensus mechanism builds the blockchain, with each chain block referencing other transaction blocks as well as the previous chain block. Transaction blocks, optimized for parallel processing, follow MCMC rules between chain blocks, resulting in a protocol that is **highly scalable, fast, and efficient**. Powered by a **Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm**, BigTangle ensures **security, decentralization, and trustless operations**.
