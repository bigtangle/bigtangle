# Cryptocurrency, Payment, Asset，Exchange and Web3 Platform


BigTangle is a cryptocurrency network that extends the blockchain with the help of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The consensus algorithm is Proof-of-Work. The consensus forms the blockchain, where each chain block contains a list of references to other transaction blocks and the previous chain block. The parallelizable transaction blocks follow the rules of MCMC between two chain blocks. This new protocol is highly parallelizable, scalable and fast.

Through the use of standard technology in conjunction with a parallelizable architecture, BigTangle positions itself as a successor to Bitcoin and Ethereum, with blockchain and smart contracts representing as special use cases.

BigTangle focuses on economically important key use-cases, supporting token issuances, transactions, exchanges, mining and contracts.

## Key Features

- **Ease of Use:** BigTangle emphasizes user-friendly interfaces.
- **Near-Time Confirmation:** Transactions are confirmed promptly.
- **High Scalability:** The platform can scale without limitations.
- **Permissionless:** Open access for all participants.
- **Trustless:** Decentralized without the need for trust.
- **Decentralized Proof of Work:** Distributes the proof-of-work mechanism.
- **Constant Total Coin and Fee:** Maintains a constant coin supply and fee pro block. The mining reward is the fees.

## Transaction

By providing scalable infrastructure, BigTangle allows the global transaction volume to be processed on a single network. This offers infrastructural cost advantages by eliminating the complex, costly processes of traditional payment processing.

## Asset and Fiat Money

For banks and central banks, the token issuance protocol can be used to issue bank-backed tokens denoting conventional fiat money and assets. Fiat money transactions can then feasibly be processed within seconds on a worldwide scale.

## Decentralized Exchange

BigTangle operates as a decentralized exchange with integrated markets for various assets such as stocks and bonds. Creating new token equivalents makes it easy for companies to issue stocks on the BigTangle network. Existing stock markets can seamlessly integrate with BigTangle as a back-end, providing a comprehensive and decentralized trading environment.

## Web3

BigTangle implements a decentralized lottery, Cross-Chain Tokens, Digital Identity and  provides web service and storage.
